## Introduction

Data structures are a critical part of computer science. They allow you to organize and store data efficiently. This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of various data structures implemented in Java. Whether you are a beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, you will find valuable information here.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cubic-guy/Data-Structures-with-Java.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd Data-Structures-with-Java
```

You can explore the various data structure implementations in the `src` folder.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Implementations**: Detailed implementations of various data structures.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each implementation comes with comments explaining the code.
- **Test Cases**: Included test cases to verify the functionality of each data structure.
- **Educational Resources**: Links to additional resources for deeper learning.

## Data Structures Overview

### Arrays

Arrays are a collection of elements identified by index or key. They are one of the simplest data structures. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **Implementation**: You can find the implementation in the `src/arrays` directory.
- **Usage**: Arrays are used for storing data in a linear fashion. They are ideal for scenarios where you need fast access to elements.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node points to the next node in the sequence.

- **Implementation**: Check the `src/linkedlists` directory for the implementation.
- **Usage**: Linked lists are useful for applications where you need dynamic memory allocation.

### Stacks

A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can add or remove elements only from the top of the stack.

- **Implementation**: Available in the `src/stacks` directory.
- **Usage**: Stacks are commonly used in algorithms like depth-first search and for managing function calls.

### Queues

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. You can add elements at the back and remove them from the front.

- **Implementation**: Find the implementation in the `src/queues` directory.
- **Usage**: Queues are useful in scenarios like scheduling tasks and managing requests.

### Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and links to other nodes. The top node is called the root.

- **Implementation**: Available in the `src/trees` directory.
- **Usage**: Trees are widely used in databases and file systems.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of a set of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. They can be directed or undirected.

- **Implementation**: Check the `src/graphs` directory for the implementation.
- **Usage**: Graphs are used in social networks, transportation networks, and more.

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order. Common algorithms include bubble sort, quicksort, and mergesort.

- **Implementation**: Available in the `src/sorting` directory.
- **Usage**: Sorting is essential for efficient data retrieval and organization.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures, simply import the relevant class in your Java program. For example, to use the stack implementation:

```java
import dataStructures.Stack;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack stack = new Stack();
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Outputs: 2
    }
}
```
